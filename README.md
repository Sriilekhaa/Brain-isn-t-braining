# V-MEDITHON

*multiple-disease-prediction-streamlit-app*

# Project Overview
This project is a Multiple Disease Prediction System that leverages machine learning models to predict the likelihood of various diseases, including:
- *Heart Disease*
- *Diabetes*
- *Parkinson's Disease*
- The system is designed to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in early disease detection, enabling timely medical intervention and potentially improving patient outcomes.

# Features
- *Heart Disease Prediction:* Based on various health parameters like age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure.
- *Diabetes Prediction:* Uses factors such as glucose levels, BMI, and insulin levels.
- *Parkinson's Disease Prediction:* Uses data points related to speech and motor symptoms.
- *User-Friendly Interface:* Provides an intuitive interface for inputting patient data and receiving predictions.
- *Scalable Models:* Machine learning models can be updated or extended to include more diseases.

# Technologies Used
- *Python:* Core programming language.
- *Machine Learning Algorithms:* Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.
- *Scikit-Learn:* For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- *Streamlit:* To deploy the prediction system as an interactive web application.
- *Pandas & Numpy:* For data manipulation and numerical computations.
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn:* For data visualization.

# Getting Started
- *1.Clone the repository:* git clone (https://github.com/RemyaaSree/vmediton_Fourtune/tree/main)
- *2.Install dependencies:*
Run the command below to install the required dependencies for the Streamlit app: *pip install -r requirements.txt*
- *3.Run the application:* streamlit run app.py
- *4.Access the application:* Open your web browser and go to the provided URL *(usually http://localhost:8501)*.

# Datasets
- The models are trained on publicly available datasets from trusted healthcare sources, such as the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
